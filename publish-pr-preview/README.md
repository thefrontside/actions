# Publish PR Preview
This action will:
- Check for accessibility to NPM token in secrets.
- Make sure this action is being run from a pull request.
- Make sure the name of the head branch of the pull request isn't `latest` to avoid conflicts with NPM tagging.
- Update package version with snapshot, publish to NPM with branch name as tag.
- Comment on pull request with instructions on how to access the package.

## Requirements
- Pass in `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- Optional: `NPM_PUBLISH` argument is available if you want to run a different command. `npm publish` will run as default.

## Usage
